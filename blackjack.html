            In Blackjack, the objective is to beat the dealer by having
            a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it. Players are
            dealt two cards, and face cards are worth 10, while Aces can
            be 1 or 11. Players can choose to "hit" for additional cards
            or "stand" to keep their current hand. The dealer reveals
            one card face up and must hit until their hand is 17 or
            higher. If the dealer busts (exceeds 21), players win.
        </p>

        <p>
            Winning occurs if a player's hand is closer to 21 than the
            dealer's. A "blackjack," an Ace and a 10-value card, usually
            pays 3:2. Ties result in a push. Players can split identical
            cards into two hands and double their original bet after the
            first two cards, hitting only once more.
