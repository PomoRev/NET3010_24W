        It really doesn't matter what she thinks as 
        it isn't her problem to solve. That's what 
        he kept trying to convince himself. She was 
        trying to insert her opinion where it wasn't 
        wanted or welcome. He already had a plan 
        and even though that plan didn't correspond 
        with what she wanted him to do or what 
        should be done, it wasn't her decision to 
        make. The question now became whether he 
        would stick to his convictions and go 
        through with his plan knowing she wouldn't 
        approve.

        The desert wind blew the tumbleweed in front 
        of the car. Alex swerved to avoid the 
        tumbleweed, but he turned the wheel a bit 
        too strong and the car left the road and 
        skidded onto the dirt median. He instantly 
        slammed on the brakes and the car stopped 
        in a cloud of dirt. When the dust cloud had 
        settled and he could see around him again, 
        he realized that he'd somehow crossed over 
        into an entirely new dimension.

        Sarah watched the whirlpool mesmerized. She 
        couldn't take her eyes off the water 
        swirling around and around. She stuck 
        in small twigs and leaves to watch the whirlpool 
        catch them and then suck them down. It bothered 
        her more than a little bit that this could also 
        be used as a metaphor for her life.
