BlackJack instructions

In Blackjack, the objective is to beat the dealer by having 
a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it. Players are 
dealt two cards, and face cards are worth 10, while Aces can 
be 1 or 11. Players can choose to "hit" for additional cards 
or "stand" to keep their current hand. The dealer reveals 
one card face up and must hit until their hand is 17 or 
higher. If the dealer busts (exceeds 21), players win.

Winning occurs if a player's hand is closer to 21 than the 
dealer's. A "blackjack," an Ace and a 10-value card, usually 
pays 3:2. Ties result in a push. Players can split identical 
cards into two hands and double their original bet after the 
first two cards, hitting only once more.

GAME LOGIC

    when to reshuffle (50% or less of deck left)

    when evaluating a hand an ace is 1 or 11 and face cards are 10

    deal cards - first card to dealer face down, remaining cards face up

    options
        hit - deals a new card to that hand, face up
        stay - hand is frozen (put value on screen?)
        bet - add to the amount bet (minimum bet?)
        bust? - what happens when a player busts 
        dealer action - after hands evaluated dealer plays, 
            dealer goes until score is 16+ or they bust.
