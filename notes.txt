BlackJack instructions

In Blackjack, the objective is to beat the dealer by having 
a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it. Players are 
dealt two cards, and face cards are worth 10, while Aces can 
be 1 or 11. Players can choose to "hit" for additional cards 
or "stand" to keep their current hand. The dealer reveals 
one card face up and must hit until their hand is 17 or 
higher. If the dealer busts (exceeds 21), players win.

Winning occurs if a player's hand is closer to 21 than the 
dealer's. A "blackjack," an Ace and a 10-value card, usually 
pays 3:2. Ties result in a push. Players can split identical 
cards into two hands and double their original bet after the 
first two cards, hitting only once more.
